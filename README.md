# DL_Project5-Char_RNN_and_Random_Decoding

Develop a recurrent neural network (RNN)designed to encode sequences of characters. After training the RNN, random decoding generate texts by starting with an initial character or sequence of characters, then repeatedly sampling the next character based on the probabilities predicted by the model.
